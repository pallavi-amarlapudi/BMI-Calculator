# BMI Calculator

A Python-based BMI calculator that takes user input for height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms), computes the Body Mass Index, and prints the result as an integer. 
This project is perfect for beginners learning Python input handling and basic arithmetic operations.

## What It Is

The Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is a simple tool to help you determine your BMI, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. 
This calculator is designed for educational purposes and provides an easy way to practice Python programming by creating a useful application.

## How It Works

The calculator asks you to enter your height in meters and your weight in kilograms. 
Using this information, it calculates your BMI.

## About Me

I'm Pallavi, a beginner in Python programming, and I created this project to practice and enhance my coding skills. 
This BMI calculator is one of my early projects, and I hope it helps others who are also learning Python. Feel free to use, share, and modify this project as you like!
